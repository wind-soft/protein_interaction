    <h2>1. Enter Protein Information</h2>
    <p>On the homepage form, enter the names of two proteins in the fields labeled "Protein 1 Name" and "Protein 2 Name". Ensure that the entered information is accurate.</p>

    <h2>2. Calculate Docking Score</h2>
    <p>Click the "Calculate Docking Score" button. The system will perform the docking score calculation between the two proteins. Wait for a moment, and once the calculation is complete, the results will be displayed.</p>

    <h2>3. View Calculation Results</h2>
    <p>Once the calculation is complete, you will see the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Docking Score:</strong> The specific numerical value representing the docking score. A higher value indicates a stronger interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction Result:</strong> Detailed interpretation of the docking score, including possible interaction types and binding strengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction Plot:</strong> A graphical representation of the interaction information, providing a visual understanding of the binding situation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Explore Calculation Steps</h2>
    <p>If you wish to explore each calculation step, navigate to the "Energy Calculation Steps" section. It contains detailed information for each step, including step number, protein pairing, and energy differences.</p>

    <h2>5. Recalculate</h2>
    <p>To initiate a new calculation, click the "Show Calculator" button, re-enter protein information, and then click "Calculate Docking Score" again.</p>

    <h2>Data Output Explanation</h2>

    <h3>1. Docking Score</h3>
    <p>The Docking Score is a specific numerical value representing the strength of interaction between the proteins. A higher score indicates a more significant interaction.</p>

    <h3>2. Interaction Result</h3>
    <p>The Interaction Result provides a detailed explanation of the Docking Score, including possible interaction types and binding strengths.</p>

    <h3>3. Interaction Plot</h3>
    <p>The Interaction Plot is a graphical representation illustrating the spatial structure of protein interactions, offering a clear visualization of the binding scenario.</p>

    <h3>4. Energy Calculation Steps</h3>
    <p>The Energy Calculation Steps table details each calculation step, including step number, protein pairing, and energy differences. These data help in understanding the computational process behind the Docking Score.</p>
